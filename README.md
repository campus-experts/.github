## What is a Campus Expert?

People learn better when they can learn with a community of likeminded peers. A Campus Expert is a student trained to build a strong technical community, on campus. As well as training, Campus Experts have access to resources and support from GitHub, such as swag, sponsorship, and the opportunity to attend events like GitHub Universe.

## How do I become a Campus Expert?

To become a Campus Expert, you first have to complete the training. To join the training, you need to be a verified student, over the age of 18. To verify as a student, sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Once you are verified as a student, you can join the [Campus Expert training](https://education.github.com/experts) ✨.

## What benefits do Campus Experts get from GitHub?

When you complete the training and become a Campus Expert, you have access to benefits and extra support from GitHub.

Campus Expert benefits depend on the training modules completed. Each training module awards access to a different set of related benefits, described in the README of the training module. As a Campus Expert completes more training modules, they will gain access to more resources to use to help their community. Benefits range from free stickers and cheat sheets for your school, to event/hackathon sponsorships, to travel support to attend GitHub events and conferences.

In addition to material resources and benefits, Campus Experts gain access to regular webinars and guest talks from industry experts, and spaces to collaborate with other Campus Experts and GitHubbers.

## How does being a Campus Expert work? What are the expectations of a Campus Expert?

During the introductory part of the training, you analyse your community and define goals for improving it. As a Campus Expert, you are expected to meet these goals, and build the best community for your campus. We at GitHub understand that you are busy students, trying to make your campus a better place. This is why you set your own community goals, and participate in as much of the training as you need to achieve those goals.

When you become a Campus Expert, you gain access to tools that help you make resource requests, and collaborate with GitHub Staff and other Campus Experts.

## Do I need to know how to use Git/GitHub?

Campus Experts is about _your community_, not becoming a Git master. However, Campus Experts and the training does primarily take place through GitHub, so some Git/GitHub knowledge is helpful. You can learn everything you need to complete the training [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/).
